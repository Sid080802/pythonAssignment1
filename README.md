# Python Assignments - Basic Programming

This repository contains solutions to six basic Python programming assignments. Each assignment covers fundamental concepts of Python, aimed at strengthening core programming skills. Below is a summary of the tasks solved.

## Assignment Questions:
1. **1. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.**: 
   - A problem that involves decision-making using if-else conditions.
   
2. **2. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.**:
   - Exercises that use loops to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
   
3. **3. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)**: 
   - A problem that demonstrates list manipulation by adding elements to a list at specific positions.
   
4. **4. Write a Python program to find the area of a triangle**:
   - A task to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height using a mathematical formula.
   
5. **5. Write a Python program to swap two variables**: 
   - An exercise that swaps the values of two variables without using a third temporary variable.
   
6. **6. Write a Python program to generate a random number**: 
   - A program that generates a random number using Python's `random` module.
